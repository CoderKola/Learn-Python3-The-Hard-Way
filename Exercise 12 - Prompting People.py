# This will also be about using input() 
# However, this part will show us that we can also put the input inside the string.
# y = input("Name? ")

age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How much do you weigh? ")

print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")

# If you do it this way, the results are saved to the variable.


# print("How old are you?", input())
# This does not work because it will request your input first without the question or the prompt.
